A few months ago, we launched a job board aggregation service called [Jobs Hub](/hub/). After trialing the product with a few customers in the Spring and Summer of 2017, we were able to gather feedback, and improve the product, which has now been re-released as a self-service API.

## What does that mean?

Instead of setting up a custom job board aggregator for each customer, we've generalized the product so that anyone can gain access to our database of tens of thousands of jobs that we collect every month. Our API is a developer-first interface that allows you to use our job board data for your site's backfill, research project, or sales lead purposes.

## New pricing for Jobs Hub

Because Jobs Hub doesn't require a custom implementation, we were able to dramatically decrease the pricing. You can [request access](/hub/) for a free API key with up to 100 queries per month, or get a paid monthly plan starting at just $20/month. For that low price, you're able to gain access to tens of thousands of listings from most of the internet's major job boards and aggregators!

To learn more, check out [Jobs Hub](/hub/) or email me at [admin@jobapis.com](mailto:admin@jobapis.com) to request a free trial API key.
