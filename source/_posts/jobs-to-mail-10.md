Just in time for 2017, I got my act together and cleaned up things in [JobsToMail](https://github.com/jobapis/jobs-to-mail) for a version 1.0.0 release. There were a lot of major changes in the project since the last release, but I've had most of them in production for weeks now, so I'm not too concerned with their stability.

## Release Highlights
- Support for 13 total job boards.
- User login via token, allowing users to view and manage job searches.
- Users can download their job listings every day in a convenient CSV file.
- Filtering recruiter job listings from our database of recruiting firms.
- Support for PHP 7.1.

## What's next for JobsToMail?

I'm actually going to be doing less work on JobsToMail for the next few months. It's been a really fun project, and I'm glad it's been useful to a few job seekers and interested developers, but JobApis as an organization has other priorities for 2017.

That said, I will continue to support the project and keep the servers running, and I encourage any developers who want to continue building it to keep the PRs coming.

Special thanks to [Soleo, Alex Knoll, and Max Lever for their contributions to version 1.0](https://github.com/jobapis/jobs-to-mail/graphs/contributors). It's been really fun working on this project with you guys and I hope to continue work in 2017!
