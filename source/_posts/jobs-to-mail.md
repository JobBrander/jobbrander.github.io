One of the things I hope to do with the JobApis organization is release open source products that help job seekers use our job board API clients and inspire developers who might want to use them. To that end, today I released our first open source product, [JobsToMail](http://www.jobstomail.com).

## What is JobsToMail?
JobsToMail is like having a personal assistant for your job search.

Just sign up at [JobsToMail.com](http://www.jobstomail.com/), choose the search term and location you'd like to search, and we'll send you new job listings every day.

One of the most annoying things to do when searching for a job (either actively or passively) is checking all the job boards for new items every day. You could sign up for their email blasts, but then you could be getting dozens of emails every day, and that's annoying. We're making the whole process simpler by sending you job listings from several job boards (6 as of this writing) in one simple daily email.

### Sign up for as many searches as you like
At this point, the project doesn't offer much management of your job searches, but you can sign up to receive multiple search emails at one address. This allows you to easily subscribe or unsubscribe from searches that are most relevant to you.

### Unsubscribe any time
Just click the unsubscribe link at the bottom of any of our emails to stop receiving emails for that search immediately. If you subscribed to multiple searches, you will need to unsubscribe from each individually.

### Clone the project and run it on your own servers
If you're a developer or you want to customize the project to meet your needs, feel free. Just [clone the project on Github](https://github.com/jobapis/jobs-to-mail) and set it up to run on your local computer or your own servers. The public project is currently hosted on Heroku, so getting it set up there should be a cinch.

### Make a suggestion or report an issue on Github
Finally, because the project is open source, you're welcome to [submit an issue](https://github.com/jobapis/jobs-to-mail/issues) or [pull request](https://github.com/jobapis/jobs-to-mail/pulls) to improve the project.

I'm looking forward to hearing from users. If you find this project useful or you have ideas, just [let me know](http://www.jobapis.com/contact/).
