## Project Overview
DEPRECATION NOTICE: As of [October, 2017 the Dice Jobs API has been shut down](https://github.com/jobapis/jobs-dice/issues/8). Dice has given me no reason for this, but there's nothing I can do about it. This library no longer works. To contact Dice, [please fill out this form on their website](http://techhub.dice.com/Dice_General-ContactUs_D.html).

The code lives on though, so [check it out on Github if you find it useful](https://github.com/jobapis/jobs-dice).
