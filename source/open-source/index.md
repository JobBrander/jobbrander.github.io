## [JobsToMail](https://github.com/jobapis/jobs-to-mail)
JobsToMail is like having a personal assistant for your job search.

Just sign up at [JobsToMail.com](http://www.jobstomail.com/), choose the search term and location you’d like to search, and we’ll send you new job listings every day.

Alternatively, JobsToMail is open source, so you can deploy it to your own server completely free of charge.
