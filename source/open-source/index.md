## [JobsToMail](https://github.com/jobapis/jobs-to-mail)
JobsToMail is like having a personal assistant for your job search.

Just sign up at [JobsToMail.com](http://www.jobstomail.com/), choose the search term and location you’d like to search, and we’ll send you new job listings every day.

Alternatively, JobsToMail is open source, so you can deploy it to your own server completely free of charge.

## [Jobs Multi](https://github.com/jobapis/jobs-multi)
Jobs Multi allows you access to multiple job board APIs with a single client. This uses the providers above to standardize both input and output.

While you get more flexibility using individual job board clients, Jobs Multi makes it easier to do common queries on multiple providers without writing a lot of code.
