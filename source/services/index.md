You are welcome to [use our open source projects](/open-source), and I
would welcome contributions if that's your thing. If you're not technical 
or don't have time to build something amazing on your own, I might be able
to help:

## Software consulting
Depending on your needs I may recommend a freelance developer, web agency, 
or help you make a plan for your application. This is primarily an open source
project, so I'd prefer to work with people who are contributing back to open 
source, but I'll hear just about anybody out.

## Data collection
If you're looking to learn more about job board data and use it for private
or research purposes let me know.

[Contact me](/contact) for more information.
